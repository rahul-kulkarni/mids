The House Price Prediction Project project aims to predict home prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, using advanced machine learning techniques. The project is based off of a dataset that includes over 80 independent variables, used as features, that capture various aspects of the residential homes. These features will form the basis of our models, specifically a regression model that will help us predict house sales prices. There will be inclusion of other models but we will focus primarily on regression and will gaugue our success by the final score determined by the model.

Our approach to this problem will be first to explore the data through our EDA and understand the data, how the variables can affect each other, and what their bottom line impact is on sale price. Through our EDA we will determine which factors are the best to focus on, allowing us to clean up the data set through feature engineering. We will then begin our modeling process and include additional EDA throughout as we gain a better understanding of the data. Following that, we will train our models with the data we select and evaluate the results. Finally, we will re-evaluate our score and update the models and features as needed, until we gain confidence that we achieved the best results we can.

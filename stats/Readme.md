The objective of this project is to identify the key determinants of crime across the state of North Carolina and  recommend crime-reduction policies. We use a linear model applying ordinary least sqaures (OLS) estimates for the covariates of criem rates. We critique our models through analyses of residuals and through the econometric framework of classic linear modles (CLM). We consider potential sources of omitted variable bias in our analysis.
